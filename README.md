## Course Overview

In this course, we will explore key topics in robotics, providing you with a strong foundation in theory and practical skills for simulating robotic systems. The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of robotics:

### 1. Kinematics and Control
- Delve into the mathematics and principles behind robot movement and control.
- Gain hands-on experience with kinematic modeling and control algorithms.
- Apply your knowledge to manipulate robot wheels and mobile robots effectively.

### 2. Image Processing (Using CNN) and Sensor Processing
- Explore the world of image processing with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Learn how to process sensor data effectively to make informed robotic decisions.
- Develop computer vision skills for object detection, recognition, and tracking.

### 3. Planning
- Learn about movement planning strategies for robotic systems.
- Dive into algorithms such as the Bug Algorithm and others for path planning.

### 4. Localization and Mapping
- Understand the essential concepts of localization to help robots find their position in the world.
- Explore mapping techniques that enable robots to build accurate representations of their environment.

## Assignments and Projects

To reinforce your learning and apply the concepts covered in each module, we have designed a series of practical assignments and the project. These tasks will challenge you to solve real-world robotics problems, allowing you to showcase your skills and creativity.

We encourage collaboration and innovation, so don't hesitate to reach out to our dedicated teaching assistants (TAs) for support and inspiration.

We are excited to embark on this robotics journey with you and look forward to seeing your progress throughout the course.
